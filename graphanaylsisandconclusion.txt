In this graph you can see the time that the merge sort algorithm took to sort the arrays. The line is similar to that of a linear-log as is expected from a merge sort which has a time complexity of O(nlogn). For the smaller arrays they took around .01 seconds and as the array size increases the time increases at a constant rate and for the largest array the time took around .2 seconds.

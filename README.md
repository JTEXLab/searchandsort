Searching and Sorting
For this assignment we will implement a sorting algorithm on an array of integers and test the efficiency of the sorting algorithm. You may implement any sorting algorithm, but you must code it yourself.

To test the efficiency of the algorithm you will need to test it on a range of different array sizes and measure the time required for the sorting. Note that you will need to use fairly large arrays to have measurable differences in the time required to sort the array.
